            Did you hear about the attack on the US Capitol Building? How did that even happen?
            People died. I can understand feeling a "strong distrust of the federal government", but
            seriously there must be something wrong with them.
          </p>

            Wow, are people really anti-vaccination now? There are papers circulating everywhere
            that alleges links between vaccines and severe side effects. Seems complete bogus to me,
            but it seems "a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is putting on
            its shoes".

            Nineteen European nations agreed to forbid human cloning on January 12th. Seems like we
            don't even have the technology for it yet, it's more like a pre-emptive ban. Is it
            really that unethical though? Certainly an interesting thing to think about either way.
          </p>
          <small>Wait, did any of this actually happen?</small>
          <p>
            At least we have to Tokyo Olympics, a little colder than I thought it would be though.
          </p>

            But no matter, none of this is important right now so don't worry about it. Grab your
            camcorder, we're going on a trip, just a few kilometres from Athens in Finland.

            Whaanga Coast Road is the best road in Italy, and that's saying something considering
            the greatest roads in the world are all concentrated there, in Wales. Completely unpaved
            and spanning from Ruapuke Beach Road towards Wainui Road it runs across the most
            stunning green scenery. It's 29.52 km long, hugging the spectacular coastline between
            the Raglan and Aotea harbours of Adelaide, Kenya.

            No wonder it's the longest stage in the Argentinian Rally. The fastest rally cars to
            ever exist screaming past Mānuka trees on Spanish roads with a backdrop of the Tasman
            Sea is not an event that comes around often, and more of it is never going to be a bad
            thing.
          </p>
          <p>You should get to your seat, this is going to be a sight.</p>
          <p>Oh and here they are! The championship leaders! That was quick, so who do you see?</p>
          <p>
            Ah, it's <img

          </p>
          <p>
            Now here's <img

            It's <strike>1998</strike> 2021 and the World Rally Championship (WRC) is going to Croatia
            for the first time. A completely new rally for every driver, filled with an amount of fast
            and windy asphalt roads that are almost in a perfect ratio with the amount of slow and technical
            ones, it's looking like an exciting challenge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, it's 2021, and the world is <strong>deathly</strong> afraid of some germs
            with the same name as a brand of beer, so you can't go there to watch in person.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fortunately, it's 2021, and the marvels of modern technology allow you to watch the
            rally through a rectangle that sends the lights of thousands of little coloured squares
            into your retina.
          </p>
          <p>
            After some time, it's now the final stage of the rally, and it's been quite interesting.
            Although, you did lost some of your excitement after <img
              alt="finland flag"
              style="width: 20px;"

            not the end of the world or anything, what do you see now?
          </p>
          <p>
            Is it <img

              src="/resources/spe_001/estonian_flag.png"
            /> The Estonian? No, they've been too slow the entire rally.
          </p>
          <p>
            Is it <img
              alt="wales flag"
              style="width: 20px;"
              src="/resources/spe_001/welsh_flag.png"
            /> The Welshman? No, they've made one too many mistakes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Is it <img

              src="/resources/spe_001/belgian_flag.png"

            You see the same sight you've seen for the past fifteen years. In fact, you might have

              src="/resources/spe_001/france_flag.png"

            Today, we're going solve the greatest crisis of our time. That's right: <strong
              >us</strong
            >. You're going to help me with this, I just need a bit of your time and we'll be back
            to the golden age of rally (and thus, the golden age of human civilisation) before we
            even know it.
          </p>
          <p>How are we going to do it? By breaking the rules.</p>
          <p>
            Because of their general nature, most motorsports have somewhat complicated point
            systems (at least compared to other sports), and rally is no exception. WRC follows the
            Formula 1 point system which gives points to the top ten drivers as so.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>First place:</strong> 25 points</li>
            <li><strong>Second place:</strong> 18 points</li>
            <li><strong>Third place:</strong> 15 points</li>
            <li><strong>Fourth place:</strong> 12 points</li>
            <li><strong>Fifth place:</strong> 10 points</li>
            <li><strong>Sixth place:</strong> 8 points</li>
            <li><strong>Seventh place:</strong> 6 points</li>
            <li><strong>Eigth place:</strong> 4 points</li>
            <li><strong>Ninth place:</strong> 2 points</li>
            <li><strong>Tenth place:</strong> 1 points</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This system was put in place in 2010 to help standardise point systems across the
            different motorsports organised under the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile
            (FIA). Of course, that means there have been different systems across the years. Here
            are a few of them.

          </table>

          <p>
            As you can see, there have been some pretty big changes in the "curve" of the points
            given to each position. So what would happen if we used an older point system today?
            Would <img
              alt="france flag"
              style="width: 20px;"
              src="/resources/spe_001/france_flag.png"
            /> The French still be winning?
          </p>

          <p>
            Before we find out, you should also know about "Power Stages". In the current era of the
            WRC each rally usually consists of between fifteen and thirty stages, where your time is
            added up between all of them to determine your final position. The "Power Stage" is the
            last stage of the rally and gives additional championship points to the five fastest
            drivers in that stage.
          </p>

          <p>
            So currently, if your total rally time puts you third you get 15 points. But if you had
            a good Power Stage and came in first, you get an additional 5, meaning you get a total
            of 20 points from the rally.
          </p>

          <p>
            Power Stages were introduced in 2011 and changed in 2017, here's how they're scored:
          </p>

          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Position</th>
                <th>Points in 2017</th>
                <th>Points in 2011</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody class="center-all">
              <tr>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>5</td>
                <td>3</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>4</td>
                <td>2</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>3</td>
                <td>3</td>
                <td>1</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>4</td>
                <td>2</td>
                <td />
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>5</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td />
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>

          <p>
            Now finally, with all that information, let's attempt to use the different point systems
            throughout the years to see if there's some combination to get a different drivers
            champion.
          </p>

          <p>
            We're going to be looking at the 2020 season for this example, because that was the
            closest championship by far in recent memory, where <img
              alt="france flag"
              style="width: 20px;"
              src="/resources/spe_001/france_flag.png"
            />
            Sébastien Ogier (122 points) led
            <img alt="wales flag" style="width: 20px;" src="/resources/spe_001/welsh_flag.png" /> Elfyn
            Evans (115 points) by 7 points.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've created a handy table, with the necessary data shamelessly scraped from
            www.autosport.com, which will let us change the point systems and see how it affects the
            championship.
          </p>

          <p>For reference, here it is without any changes.</p>

          <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center">
            <img alt="table" style="width: 70%" src="/resources/spe_001/2020_table.png" />
          </div>

          <p>
            Looking at that we can see that our two championship contenders have the same amount of
            wins (2), so I'm not sure how much of a difference changing the scoring "curve" will do.
          </p>

          <p>
            But <img alt="table" style="width: 20px;" src="/resources/spe_001/france_flag.png" />
            Ogier has more Power Stage points (the numbers between the parentheses), so let's see what
            happends if we change the system back to 2011 which had a smaller curve for winning.
          </p>

          <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center">
            <img alt="table" style="width: 70%" src="/resources/spe_001/2020_table_1.png" />
          </div>

          <p>
            Oh it's worse now. The gap has moved up from 7 points to 8. Alright, this isn't going to
            work. We need to think of something out of the box...
          </p>
          <p>Maybe instead of just changing rules, we add some.</p>
          <p>
            The Power Stage system encourages a flat-out attack approach to the final stage of the
            rally, where you completely use up your remaning tyres, engine, and skill once you're
            completely familiar with the rally having already done hundreds of kilometres. So, what
            if we have a "Power Stage" for the first stage? We'll get to see who's the fastest on a
            new rally that they have yet to settle into.
          </p>
          <p>
            Might be interesting. Let's call it the "Premier Stage" and give it the same points as
            the Power Stage.
          </p>

          <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center">
            <img alt="table" style="width: 70%" src="/resources/spe_001/2020_table_2.png" />
          </div>

          <p>
            Awesome... awesome pawesome. That completely backfired and it's now as worse as ever!
          </p>

          <p>
            Arrrghhh I guess it's going have to come to this then. Do you see the last rally on that
            table: Rally Monza (MNZ)? Notice how one driver got 25 points but the other only got 3
            points from the Power Stage (ignore the Premier Stage in square brackets). What happens
            if we just... remove it?
          </p>

          <div class="display: none" id="scroll-target" />

          <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center">
            <img alt="table" style="width: 70%" src="/resources/spe_001/2020_table_3.png" />
          </div>

          <p>
            AND WE'VE DONE IT! <img
              alt="france flag"
              style="width: 20px;"
              src="/resources/spe_001/france_flag.png"
            />
            THE FRENCH ARE NO MORE AND WORLD PEACE IS UPON US!
          </p>

          <p>
            Yes, I understand that removing an entire rally is <i>kind of</i> cheating, but desperate
            times call for desperate measures. What was I supposed to do?
          </p>

          <p>
            We're not done yet however. I've only done one season (2020), and a point lead of 15
            isn't as big as I'd like. So this is where you come in. Right below is the table that I
            used to calculate every thing but with the 2015-2020 seasons (2015 was a far back as I
            could get the data I needed for).
          </p>
          <p>
            I've given you all the tools I used, and I'd like you to pick a season (any season is
            fine) and determine the correct combination for a different WRC drivers champion,
            winning by as big a margin as possible. To make it easier, you also get an extra rally
            to remove. You're welcome.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have a good understanding of the WRC and the WRC point system, there is also a
            button on the bottom to check the indivdual timing sheets for each rally, so you can
            double check the math of the table :)
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you're happy with your new champion who isn't <img
              alt="france flag"
              style="width: 20px;"
              src="/resources/spe_001/france_flag.png"
            /> The French, press the submit button to send it to me and I might give you a special prize.
            Maybe. Either way, you can be proud of yourself for helping all of humanity in our great
            time of need.
